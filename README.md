# mealq

Grab meals with friends without frictions.


Grabbing meals with friends should not be a logistic headache. mealq is where you can send meal invites to friends, manage time and location, message participants all in one place so you can focus on actually going out and spending quality time with your friends.


#### MEAL INVITE

• Asking friends out for a meal through a few taps.

• Don't have a specific date in mind? Worry about that later or just pick any weekday, you can always narrow it down later!

• Customize your meal name to grab your friends' attentions (and appetites).


#### ACTIVITIES

• See what your friends are up to.

• A way to discover new friends -- saw your friend invited someone you don't know? Send a friend request and get to know them better!

• Unlock insights on the strength of your (or your friends') friendship.


#### CHATS

• Each created/accepted meal will come with a group chat.

• Something just came up? Change the meal time with a few taps without having to texting.

• Set and a pin a location so everyone can see.

Have fun with your meal!
